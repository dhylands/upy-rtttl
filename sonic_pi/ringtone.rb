#ringtone.rb
#this script retrieves ringtone data using a python script
#to create a .json format file containing two lists
#'freqs' which contains a list of note frequencies
#"durs which cotnains a correspending list of durations in msecs.
#the file is loaded into Sonic Pi and the two data lists extracted
#they are then played using the chiplead synth
#I've transposed the data down an octave in the play command
#conversion to sonic pi play format is easy using the built in hz_to_midi command

#the list of songs refers to those songs whose data in in the songs.py file
path= '/Users/rbn/src/upy-rtttl/' #path to python files adjust for your system.
