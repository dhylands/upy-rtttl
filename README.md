Ring Tone Text Transfer Language Parser
=======================================

This library can parse RTTTL text lines and delivers the frequency and duration
for each note.

A typical RTTTL string looks like this:
```
Entertainer:d=4,o=5,b=140:8d,8d#,8e,c6,8e,c6,8e,2c.6,8c6,8d6,8d#6,8e6,8c6,8d6,e6,8b,d6,2c6,p,8d,8d#,8e,c6,8e,c6,8e,2c.6,8p,8a,8g,8f#,8a,8c6,e6,8d6,8c6,8a,2d6
```

# Using RTTTL on the pyboard

Instantiate an instance of the RTTTL class, passing in the tune string to the
constructor.
```python
tune = RTTTL('Entertainer:d=4,o=5,b=140:8d,8d#,8e,c6,8e,c6,8e,2c.6,8c6,8d6,8d#6,8e6,8c6,8d6,e6,8b,d6,2c6,p,8d,8d#,8e,c6,8e,c6,8e,2c.6,8p,8a,8g,8f#,8a,8c6,e6,8d6,8c6,8a,2d6')
```

Then use the notes generator to enumerate the notes in the tune. The notes
generator will return a tuple, where the first entry in the tuple contains
the frequency of the note (in Hz) and the second entry in the tuple contains
the duration of the note.
```python
for freq, msec in tune.notes():
    play_tone(freq, msec)
```

When using a piezo you basically provide a 50% PWM signal to the piezo using the frequency of the note. Some piezo speakers can vary the volume by using a different duty cycle. The piezo on the G30DEV board Dave Hylands this on, it didn't seem to make any difference.

In order to distinguish consecutive notes, you need a small gap between the notes.
Dave Hylands chose to use 90% of the duration to play the tone, and 10% of duration to play silence.

Dave Hylands used the following play_tone routine on the G30DEV board:
```python
import pyb
buz_tim = pyb.Timer(3, freq=440)
buz_ch = buz_tim.channel(1, pyb.Timer.PWM, pin=pyb.Pin.board.BUZZER, pulse_width=0)
def play_tone(freq, msec):
    print('freq = {:6.1f} msec = {:6.1f}'.format(freq, msec))
    if freq > 0:
        buz_tim.freq(freq)
        buz_ch.pulse_width_percent(50)
    pyb.delay(int(msec * 0.9))
    buz_ch.pulse_width_percent(0)
    pyb.delay(int(msec * 0.1))
```

Dave Hylands put a recording of the above on YouTube: https://youtu.be/TadV2AEvfww

When using pin Y2 on a pyboard v1.0, change the timer/pin to:
```python
buz_tim = pyb.Timer(8, freq=440)
buz_ch = buz_tim.channel(2, pyb.Timer.PWM, pin=pyb.Pin('Y2'), pulse_width=0)
```

To see which timers are available on which pins, consult the MicroPython quickref:
http://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/pyboard/pyboard/quickref.html

David Glaude used the following play_tone routine on Circuit Python M0 board:
```
import board
import pulseio
import time

speaker_pin   = board.D0  # Speaker is connected to this DIGITAL pin

# Initialize input/output pins
pwm       = pulseio.PWMOut(speaker_pin, variable_frequency=True, duty_cycle=0)

def play_tone(freq, msec):
#    print('freq = {:6.1f} msec = {:6.1f}'.format(freq, msec))
    if freq > 0:
        pwm.frequency  = int(freq)   # Set frequency
        pwm.duty_cycle = 32767  # 50% duty cycle
	time.sleep(msec*0.001)  # Play for a number of msec
    pwm.duty_cycle = 0          # Stop playing
    time.sleep(0.05)            # Delay 50 ms between notes
```
